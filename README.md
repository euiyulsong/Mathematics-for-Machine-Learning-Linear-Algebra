1. Wrote a function that will test if a 4×4 matrix is singular by determining if an inverse exists, before calculating it
2. Converted a matrix to echelon form, and testing if this fails by leaving zeros that can’t be removed on the leading diagonal
3. Wrote a code to construct an orthonormal basis that spans a set of input vectors, here you will take a matrix which takes simple form in that basis, and transform it into our starting basis
4. Took the inverse of a matrix, give the transpose of a matrix, and produce a matrix of orthonormal column vectors given a general matrix of column vector by performing the Gram-Schmidt process
5. Built on your knowledge of eigenvectors and eigenvalues by exploring the PageRank algorithm for an arbitrarily large probability matrix
